# About Dataset

Drosophila Melanogaster
Drosophila Melanogaster, the common fruit fly, is a model organism which has been extensively used in entymological research. It is one of the most studied organisms in biological research, particularly in genetics and developmental biology.

When its not being used for scientific research, D. melanogaster is a common pest in homes, restaurants, and anywhere else that serves food. They are not to be confused with Tephritidae flys (also known as fruit flys).

# First jupytor notebook

Getting Started with Biopython
Myles O'Neill - based on http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html

Biopython is a library we can use to analyze bioinformatic data. Lets have a look at some of the things we can do with it!

This script will go through a selection of tutorial excercises from the Biopython cookbook. I've tweaked them a bit to work with the Drosophila dataset we are using
